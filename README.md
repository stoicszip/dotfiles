# I switched back to gentoo (again), so I don't maintain/update these dotfiles anymore. Instead check out: https://github.com/stoicszip/dotfiles-gentoo

These are some dotfiles for my main workstation. It includes homemanager, flake and the normal NixOS configuration file.
I use NixOS unstable, with a fallback on stable packages if necessary.

Disclaimer:
I'm still pretty new to NixOS, so I will probably update the files pretty often.

I recommend checking out this unofficial handbook: https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/
It helped me to understand the concept of flakes and Home Manager.
